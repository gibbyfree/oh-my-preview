# Description

This program is a basic script that can be used to quickly preview oh-my-zsh themes by automating the modification of the .zshrc file. Since I developed the program for personal use, it currently only works on MacOS in Terminal, and does not perform any validation on the theme names passed in at the command line.

# Usage

`` ./omp [theme-name]``
